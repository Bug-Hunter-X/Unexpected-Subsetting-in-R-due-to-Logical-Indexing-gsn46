```r
# This code attempts to subset a data frame based on a condition,
# but it produces unexpected results due to how R handles logical indexing.

df <- data.frame(a = c(1, 2, 3), b = c(4, 5, 6))

# The problem lies in the following line:
result <- df[df$a > 1 & df$b < 6, ]

# The expected result would be a data frame with only the row where a > 1 and b < 6
# However, R's recycling mechanism may lead to unexpected behavior if the logical vectors have different lengths.
# In this case, the condition will not always work as intended.

print(result)
