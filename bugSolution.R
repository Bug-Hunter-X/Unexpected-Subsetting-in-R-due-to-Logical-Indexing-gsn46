# This improved code addresses the issue of implicit recycling by explicitly checking vector lengths and using a more robust condition.

df <- data.frame(a = c(1, 2, 3), b = c(4, 5, 6))

# Check that both conditions have the same length. if not throw an error to alert the user
if(length(df$a > 1) != length(df$b < 6)){stop("Error: Condition vectors must have the same length.")}
# Correctly subset the data frame using the logical condition. No implicit recycling happens
result <- df[(df$a > 1) & (df$b < 6), ]

print(result)
