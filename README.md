This repository contains an example of an uncommon R code error related to logical indexing and recycling. The `bug.R` file demonstrates the issue where incorrect subsetting happens due to implicit recycling of logical vectors in a condition. The `bugSolution.R` file offers a corrected version, which uses explicit vector length checks to prevent unexpected behavior.  This example highlights the importance of careful condition construction when working with logical indexing in R.
